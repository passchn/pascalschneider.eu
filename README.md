My new homepage, created with gridsome/VueJS. 

All content is organized in JSON files and importet onto the site through GraphQL. In this way it is easy to support multiple languages. The language can be changed in the gridsome.server.js before the build process. 

JSON files should have identical names and be in a folder depending on the language, e.g., /src/data/de/index.json or /src/data/en/index.json. The site can then be hosted on shared hosting, e.g. one.com.
